# Exploratory-Data-Analysis(EDA)
Here i have done a project on Exploratory Data Analysis to analyze,to visualize and to summarize all about a dataset of employees working in ABC company.Steps to perform this project are as the following:

## step1:imported the required modules numpy,pandas,seaborn,matplotlib
## Step2: 

Data preprocessing:

*it is the concept of changing the raw data into a clean data set.
*Corrected the values of column 'Height' by replacing random values.
                   
## Step3:*Analyzing the number of percentage splitting w.r.t total employees in each team:
      *calculated the employee count and percentage distribution
      *visualized the data using barplot
## step4:*seggregated the employees w.r.t different position
      *illustrated the same using countplot
      
## step5:*found out the age group most of the employees belong to:
      *visualized the age distribution using countplot for the clear insight.
      
## step6:salary analysis:
      *Determined the team and position with the highest salary spending.
      *plotted the above data using boxplot which illustrates the relationship between team,position and salary.
      
## step7:Correlation between Age and salary:
      *correlated the relationship between the age and salary of the employees.
      *plotted it using heatmap which is a two dimensional representation of data.
      
## conclusion:
          The analysis provided the clear insights of the whole dataset in which includes data preprocessing,team distribution,salary expenditures across different positions,age group identification,salary analysis, correlation between age and salary and clear visualization of the whole data regarding the ABC Company.
